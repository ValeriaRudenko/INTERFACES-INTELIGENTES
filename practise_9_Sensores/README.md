Overview
This Unity project demonstrates the integration of mobile device sensors, such as the gyroscope, accelerometer, and location services, to create a simple application that updates the orientation of an object and displays relevant data on the user interface (UI).

Usage
Attach the Move script to the GameObject you want to control based on device sensors.
Attach the UIManager script to a UI GameObject that has Text components for displaying data.
Run the application on a mobile device.
Observe the changes in object orientation and UI data based on gyroscope, accelerometer, and location services.
