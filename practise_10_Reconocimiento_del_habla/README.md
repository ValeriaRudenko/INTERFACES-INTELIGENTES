# Voice Recognition
This project is a practical exercise designed to explore voice recognition capabilities within Unity, using the Hugging Face API. The goal is to create an APK (Android application) that integrates voice commands to control the behavior of spiders in a Unity scene featuring zombies and spiders.
Below are gif images that show how the exercises are performed.
